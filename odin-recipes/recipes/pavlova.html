        <h1>Easy Pavlova Recipe</h1>
        <h2>What is Pavlova?</h2>
        <p>Pavlova is a meringue-based dessert that originated in New Zealand. The elegant dish is named after Anna Pavlova, a Russian ballerina. It has a crisp meringue crust, a soft whipped cream interior, and a fruit topping.  </p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>4 large egg whites</li>
            <li>1 1/4 cups white sugar</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons cornstarch</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon lemon juice</li>
            <li>pint heavy cream</li>
            <li>6 kiwi fruit, peed and sliced</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Step 1.</li>
            <p>Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C).</p>
            <li>Step 2.</li>
            <p>Line a baking sheet with parchment paper; draw a 9-inch circle on the parchment paper.</p>
            <li>Step 3.</li>
            <p>Beat egg whites in a glass, metal, or ceramic bowl until stiff but not dry. Gradually add sugar, about 1 tablespoon at a time, beating well after each addition. Continue beating until meringue is thick, white, and glossy.            </p>
            <Li>Step 4.</Li>
            <p>Gently fold in cornstarch, vanilla extract, and lemon juice. </p>
            <li>Step 5.</li>
            <p>Spoon mixture inside the circle drawn on the parchment paper. Working from the center, spread mixture toward the outside edge and build the edge slightly. This should leave a slight depression in the center.</p>
            <li>Step 6.</li>
            <p>Bake in the preheated oven until meringue is dry and sounds hollow when tapped, about 1 hour. Cool on a wire rack.</p>
            <li>Step 7.</li>
            <p>Beat heavy cream in a medium bowl until stiff peaks form; set aside. Remove meringue from the parchment paper and place on a flat serving plate.</p>
            <li>Step 8.</li>
            <p>Fill center of meringue with whipped cream and top with kiwi slices.</p>
            <li>Step 9</li>
            <p>Top with fruit and enjoy!</p>
